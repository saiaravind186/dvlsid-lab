1. A Line follower Robot uses 2 Infra-Red (IR) sensors to detect the colour of the surface. Sensor output is High when white surface is detected and Low on a black surface. Try to model the Robot controller and then implement itâ€™s hardware? A Line follower Robot uses 2 Infra-Red (IR) sensors to detect the colour of the surface.
