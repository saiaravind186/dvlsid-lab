1. Write a Verilog code of 4-to-1 multiplexer as UDP and verify the design description by simulation.
2. Write a Verilog code for 4-bit binary-to-gray code converter using two-input xor gate UDP and verify the design by simulation.
3. Write a Verilog code to define and call the function that evaluates the two-input exor expression and verify the code by simulation.
4. Write a Verilog code for the positive-edge-triggered D flip-flop as UDP and verify the design by simulation.
